* Dotfiles


** Overview
My configuration files for *Emacs*, *Vim*, *Alacritty* and *Fish* and *LaTeX*.

The *texmf* directory holds the templates that I commonly use for *LaTeX* files. Keep in mind that I use =minted=, which requires compilation with the =-shell-escape= flag, and the Python =pygments= package.


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install pygments
#+END_SRC


** Setup/Installation


Setup was done by following [[https://mjones44.medium.com/storing-dotfiles-in-a-git-repository-53f765c0005d][this guide]].

To add files to be tracked:

#+begin_src bash
config add /path/to/file/cool.rs
config commit -m "Added cool.rs"
config push
#+end_src


To install on a new system, run the following command:

#+begin_src bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hydrobeam/dotfiles/main/config-init | bash
#+end_src

This will (in theory), move conflicting config setups to =.dotfiles-backup=, and insert the ones here in their place.
