* Dotfiles

** Overview
My configuration files for *Emacs*, *Vim*, *Alacritty* and *Fish* and *LaTeX*.

The *texmf* directory holds the templates that I commonly use for *LaTeX* files. Keep in mind that I use =minted=, which requires compilation with the =-shell-escape= flag, and the Python =pygments= package.


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
pip install pygments
#+END_SRC


** Setup/Installation

*** Installing
Use [[https:yadm.io][yadm]] to manage dotfiles.

After installing ~yadm~, setting up is as simple as:

#+begin_src bash
yadm clone https://github.com/hydrobeam/dotfiles.git
#+end_src

That's it!

*** Adding new files

~yadm~ is basically just a git repository, so to add files to be tracked:

#+begin_src bash
yadm add /path/to/file/cool.rs
yadm commit -m "Added cool.rs"
yadm push
#+end_src
