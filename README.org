* Dotfiles

** Overview
My configuration files for *Emacs*, *Vim*, *Alacritty* and *Fish* and *LaTeX* & more.

The *texmf* directory holds the templates that I commonly use for *LaTeX* files. I rely on [[https://github.com/tecosaur/engrave-faces][engrave-faces]] to syntax-highlight code blocks.
This is unique to Emacs & Org mode.

** Setup/Installation

*** Installing
Use [[https://yadm.io][yadm]] to manage dotfiles.

If on a remote server, to place ~yadm~ in =~/bin=:

#+begin_src bash
curl -fLo ~/bin/yadm https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/raw/master/yadm && chmod +x ~/bin/yadm
#+end_src

After installing ~yadm~, setting up is as simple as:

#+begin_src bash
yadm clone https://github.com/hydrobeam/dotfiles.git
#+end_src

That's it!

*** Adding new files

~yadm~ is basically just a git repository, so to add files to be tracked:

#+begin_src bash
yadm add /path/to/file/cool.rs
yadm commit -m "Added cool.rs"
yadm push
#+end_src
