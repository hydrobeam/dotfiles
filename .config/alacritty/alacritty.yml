# check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
# available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.

  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal

  #
  # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.

  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
